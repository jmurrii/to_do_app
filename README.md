## Summary
In the Fifth exercise of Andy Sterkowitz' Software Development Mastermind Program, I was given the task of creating a To-Do List application.
In completing the project I learned how to manipulate the dom, specifically how to add and delete objects dynamically with Javascript.
I also learned how to use the target event property and use the information it returns.
